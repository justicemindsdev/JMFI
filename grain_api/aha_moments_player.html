So just the time stops. She. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>We have to fix it starting from there to when we have where it has to stop that she will <v Kajha Nainamohamed>figure it out. Are we clear? <v Ben Mak>Yeah. I don't mind doing stuff Queen Jen, if. <v Ben Mak>If you have the capacity to even just say something like I. I spend hours figuring this stuff out. <v Ben Mak>I don't mind if. If I'm figuring something out. You. <v Ben Mak>If you understand what I'm doing and because you can just look at something and go, I know what's wrong <v Ben Mak>with it. I don't mind figuring it out with your. And then I'll figure it out. <v Ben Mak>I don't mind doing that. So you're not left to do it. I. I genuinely want to learn. <v Ben Mak>So if I do stuff. Sh. Just. Say I'm doing this and you might be able to go. <v Ben Mak>That curly bracket is disgusting. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>You know what? She told me one thing. To find the starting point in timestamp. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>She tried everything, it didn't work. She gone to bed. In her dream, did she find the answer? <v Kajha Nainamohamed>She found the answer in her dream. The next day morning she tried that same thing. It worked. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>That's what she told me. <v Jenofar Nisha>Yeah, most joking. I got the most of the results via my dreams only. <v Ben Mak>Right? Dream, what dream? Witch building. <v Jenofar Nisha>It's like I just keep thinking about that, how to resolve that, how to resolve that. <v Jenofar Nisha>So I just got some idea. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>She got her answer as an idea in her dream. <v Jenofar Nisha>Is this I just open, is it like 3 o' clock, 4 o' clock? <v Jenofar Nisha>I just open my laptop and put it like that? Yeah, it's okay, like just listen. <v Ben Mak>Is this a common practice? AI Jan, what's it called? <v Kajha Nainamohamed>I don't know, I've done it many times. <v Ben Mak>Why are you sitting there head to like balls deep in voodoo? <v Ben Mak>I'm not even telling me how to cast the spell. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>We don't know that's how it is. <v Ben Mak>What do you mean that's how it is? <v Kajha Nainamohamed>We don't know how it is. But that's how my brain works. Basically her brain works. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>Her brain works better than mine. I cannot compete with her. But still. <v Ben Mak>So Jen, you're saying to me you go to bed and you do what to get profit messages from the <v Ben Mak>gods? Please share.</div>

But that's not what happens. Happens. Narcissism becomes the key driver, it becomes the autopilot. <v Ben Mak>It doesn't get left and it harms people. <v Ben Mak>Just like if you left your child in the bath, it would not look good, but you could, but you <v Ben Mak>wouldn't do that because of the damage. People just don't understand that the tool of narcissism is that damage. <v Ben Mak>So I've got a chat about that tomorrow. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>Okay. <v Ben Mak>And it's going to be really good because it is about like Indian populace. <v Ben Mak>But anyway, he was saying that I told him about the situation with Mr. <v Ben Mak>Thora and even he was a bit perplexed and he was just like, narcissists. <v Ben Mak>The issue is they can like you and also deceive you. They can love you and harm you. <v Ben Mak>That's the, that's, that's the upness of it. And that's what they've done. Yeah, they can do both simultaneously. <v Ben Mak>They can be nice and like. Yeah, and also hate you and lie to you. It's. <v Ben Mak>And that's what they've done. And he said it's hard to get money from Indians. Be aware. <v Ben Mak>And he also said in, in the approach, he said the biggest thing is public shaming more than anything said <v Ben Mak>because indoors and behind doors they can deal with it. He's like, but publicly he's like, that's the killer. <v Ben Mak>He's like, so. <v Ben Mak>But he went, but if you are not coming into it with, with credentials yourself, you're wasting your time. <v Ben Mak>I was like, oh, just got honorary doctorate. <v Ben Mak>And he was like, yeah, well, you'll need all that as much as you can. <v Ben Mak>He went, are you wasting your time?</div>

Bye. <v Ben Mak>What you actually meant is, I should have. I. <v Kajha>It wasn't like that. Because I was. I know. I was ready to accept the fact. And I was. <v Kajha>I don't want to waste my time with PSW paying money, tons of money, getting the useless visa. <v Kajha>I was ready to go back home. That's why I said, I'm going home. <v Ben Mak>And that's not what I set out to do. And I'm not like you. I commit. So. <v Ben Mak>Although the pressures were high. Exactly. But I was committed. <v Kajha>I skipped to you because I was. I. I accepted that I don't want the PSW visa. <v Kajha>Like, it's waste of time and money because I'm not going to earn anything. <v Ben Mak>Oh, that's. <v Kajha>That's even. <v Ben Mak>I'm not going to get. And. <v Ben Mak>And that is the difference between a winner mindset and a loser mindset accepts defeat. <v Ben Mak>And it's big enough to stop them getting what they want. Even now. <v Kajha>Even now, the new one. If I don't get it, we will get it eventually. <v Kajha>I'm saying if I have to go back home, I'll accept hon. And then I'll have to go home. <v Ben Mak>Right? That is a recipe for disaster. Let me teach you something about leadership. <v Kajha>A leader. <v Ben Mak>A leader doesn't say to a. A sea of people, hi, guys, follow me. <v Ben Mak>You might die, but it might be nice. It doesn't say that. A leader does not. <v Ben Mak>Obviously not, but that's what you're saying. If I don't get it, I'll just go home and it'll be fine. <v Ben Mak>That's like saying, guys, we're gonna go to a new land. It's amazing. But we might die. <v Ben Mak>But it might be.

You're following your video. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>She said okay. <v Ben Mak>Actually that's a good idea. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>Yeah. <v Ben Mak>If you, if you know how to do it, do it once and then Kaja would love to learn with <v Ben Mak>me how to do it. But you might. We might have a bit of coding inertia. <v Ben Mak>Kaja codes are very, very like peculiar when it comes to working and being seen by a human. <v Ben Mak>The tentatively recluse into a cave and evaporate and just come back with a product complete. <v Kajha Nainamohamed>Yeah.</div>

So whatever, like WhatsApp group chat you're in. <v Ben Mak>We'll give you a form and it'll have the mission that needs to be rectified.

You don't get paid for your break, do you? Yeah. <v Ben Mak>So when it's a bank holiday, that should be an extra. All these little things that add up. <v Ben Mak>You lose leadership on bank holidays, public holidays, you don't get paid for your break. <v Ben Mak>So if you lose pay for having a free time, then you should gain a day of sponsor and, and <v Ben Mak>that sort of thing. So. But yeah, we're all getting together. <v Ben Mak>Everyone's going to say what they feel and we're going to come up with a collective goal that everyone wants <v Ben Mak>because one person, It's a grievance. 20 experts, masters and PhDs and MBAs is a collation, it's a board. <v Ben Mak>It's like you can't ignore them.

          <div class="transcript"><v Jenofar Nisha>So if it is a HTML file, I just need to show that page replications only, right? <v Kajha Nainamohamed>Oh yeah. <v Jenofar Nisha>Then what about the TSX file? It has any components, any functions. <v Ben Mak>So just whatever it is, which is probably okay. <v Jenofar Nisha>I know. So basically, since if it is an HTML file, we can run it anywhere in the browser. <v Jenofar Nisha>So we can show the show the thing about the HTML page results. <v Jenofar Nisha>But in the TSX file it has any components, right? <v Jenofar Nisha>So we need to show that results also in the same page, right? <v Jenofar Nisha>If it is CS file to show this analysis data, otherwise we need to show the website those things. <v Jenofar Nisha>Am I right? <v Ben Mak>Yeah, but what I'm saying is, is like when I have a TSX file, it's everything is usually in the <v Ben Mak>one file, usually never one file. So this is what we were saying. <v Ben Mak>Like the CSV should be fine, the HTML should be fine because it should just load if we put it <v Ben Mak>in, it might be worth if there is three buttons. Maybe on the. <v Ben Mak>On the thing that you've made on the upload CSV. <v Ben Mak>Because then we can click if it's a tsx, HTML or CSV, which is quite useful because it means it <v Ben Mak>will tend it down a different rabbit hole depending on what it is. <v Ben Mak>Which means it'll get rendered correctly and just appear on the left and show on the. On the main screen. <v Ben Mak>Does that make sense?</div>
